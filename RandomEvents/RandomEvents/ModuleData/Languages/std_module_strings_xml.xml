You manage to find a nice clearing not to far into the woods where you sit down and lean against a big boulder to relax. As you sit there you notice there is a light approaching in the sky from the south. You stand up and look at the light that now has come even closer. It's glowing and keeps changing colors, but it hovers in the sky without a sound. After you've stared at the light for a few minutes it disappears over the treeline. Having no clue to what you witnessed you make your way back but you are somewhat shocked when you see the sun is rising in the east as by your calculations it's just after midnight. You make haste back to the main camp.\nWhen you arrive some of your high ranking men run towards you and asks you where you have been. Perplexed, you answer them and tell them about the strange light. You are shocked when the men tell you that you have been gone for over 5 hours.\n\nA few hours later your party is on the move again but the men can clearly notice that you are preoccupied with last nights events." />

You pick it up and study it for a few seconds before it crumbles to ash before your eyes.\n\nYou also notice that you have several small, fresh scars on your extremities. They are small, and all are identical, perfectly rounded with no signs of bleeding from the wounds. You are even more shocked when you realize that you are, in fact, missing two of your molars and the nails on your right foot are gone. This event now has you scared senseless.\n\nAs night falls, and you drifting to sleep along with the last remnants of daylight you suddenly awaken, drenched in sweat, heart beating fast and you also notice that you have wet the bed. You try to recall the dream as you make your way to the nightstand where your diary is. You attempt to write down what you remember." />

I faint from horror.”\n\n“When I regain consciousness, I find myself strapped to a cold metallic table and I notice that I am surrounded by three strange creatures. These creatures look somewhat like humans, except from the fact they are somewhat smaller and their faces are covered in thick hair. Their ears and noses are for some reason hairless.”\n\n“I lie there unable to move as the creatures poke me with several instruments and take notes, all while I can hear their unrecognizable language.
